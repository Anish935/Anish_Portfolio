# FIFA 21 Analytics Project

## Cleaning and Organising Data Set

The FIFA 21 dataset contains a wide range of information about players including their names, nationalities, positions, team affiliations, and various skill ratings. To prepare this dataset for analysis we should consider the following steps:

1. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Some columns may not be relevant for analysis. For example, `photoUrl` and `playerUrl` might not be needed.

2. **Clean Data**: Address any missing or inconsistent data. For instance, the `Hits` column appears to have newline characters.

3. **Normalize Text Data**: Ensure consistency in text data like team names, positions, and nationalities.

4. **Convert Data Types**: Some columns might be better represented in different data types. For example, ratings should be numeric.

5. **Extract Useful Information**: Some columns contain multiple pieces of information. For instance, `Team & Contract` could be split into separate columns for team and contract duration.

6. **Handle Columns with Mixed Types**: As indicated by the warning, at least one column has mixed data types which should be addressed.

## Potential Areas for Insight

To draw insights from the cleaned and organized FIFA 21 dataset, we can explore various aspects of the data. Some potential areas of analysis include:

- **Player Demographics**: Analyzing the distribution of players' ages, nationalities, and teams. This can reveal which countries or clubs are most represented in the game.

- **Skill Ratings**: Examining the distribution of overall ratings (`â†“OVA`), potential ratings (`POT`), and specific skill attributes like pace (`PAC`), shooting (`SHO`), etc. Insights could include identifying the top-rated players, positions with the highest skill ratings, or trends in player abilities.
